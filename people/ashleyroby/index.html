    <p>Hi, I'm Ashley. I'm a web development student! I'm happily married to my best friend. I have
      a fur baby, a Borador, named Luna Bella. I love to paint, draw, read
      and watch movies, and any outdoor activity. I am a Certified Scuba Diver and love diving shipwrecks, though its been a few years. I am excited
      to start a new career finally! APPLE!
